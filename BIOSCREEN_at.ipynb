    "<mark>Threshold Concentration:</mark> The evaluation of the analytical solution shows, that the contaminant concentration $C \\to 0$ for $x \\to \\infty$. Due to this asymptotical convergence, it is required to provide a threshold concentration, which defines the $L_{max}$ concentration contour level. This threshold should be close to a concentration of 0 or one could also choose value equaling water quality standards.</div>\n",

    "\n",
    "<div align=\"justify\">\n",
    "<mark>Time:</mark> The BIOSCREEN analytical solution is a transient solution, which means that the state of the contaminant plume is dependent of time. The interaction of plume growing effects and attenuation processes will often result in a state of equilibrium in which the plume keeps a constant size. It is not possible to define a global valid period after which a steady state is reached, since this dependes heavily on the hydrogeologic conditions. However, a simple approximation can be used based on the decay within the plume $t=\\frac{1}{\\lambda}+5$ [y]. But it is important to note that this approach does <b>not<\\b> guarantee the steady state of the plume. It is therefore recommended to use a value of at least 20 years (default value).  </div>\n",
